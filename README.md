# wifi-p2p-streaming

## About the Project üí°

This project demonstrates how to connect and share camera streaming between Android devices using Wifi-direct and socket. 

This wraps all framework's Wifi-direct and CameraX APIs and packs into Android library modules for fast and convenient use.

üöÄ**Technical specification**:
* Provides separate APKs for both server and client sides.
* Support peer-to-peer connection via `Wifi-direct`.
* Data transmission via `Datagram socket (UDP)`.
* Build with `CameraX` APIs.
* Support video recording on client side with `AVC(H264)` encoder.
* Improve performance.

üõ£Ô∏è**Upcoming road map**:
* Add support for other protocols: `Streaming socket (TCP)`, `RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)`.
* Add streaming quality selections: `SD`, `HD`, `Full HD`.
* Add support for other encoders: `HEVC(H265)`, `MPEG4`.
